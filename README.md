The Conversational AI System is a full-stack MERN platform that enables real-time group communication enhanced by intelligent AI support. Users can join shared chat rooms, collaborate instantly, and exchange messages through a live WebSocket-powered system. Integrated into the platform is Google Gemini, which provides on-demand AI assistance for answering questions, summarizing discussions, generating code, and helping users debug or execute programming tasks. Alongside its collaborative features, the system allows users to run code directly through supported backend endpoints, giving developers immediate, in-chat feedback on logic or syntax issues. Combined with a clean React interface and a structured Node.js/Express backend, the project delivers a powerful environment where teamwork, learning, and AI-driven productivity come together seamlessly.
